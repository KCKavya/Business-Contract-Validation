# Business-Contract-Validation
This project is a Streamlit application for highlighting contracts and performing Named Entity Recognition (NER). The application classifies content within contract clauses, determines deviations from a template, and highlights them.      This code generates and saves 5 synthetic business contracts to separate text files.
